        <div class="about-section-content">
          <div class="body-text">Hello! I'm Sergei Voloboev, a recent graduate from the Technical University of Munich with a master's degree in Data Engineering and Analytics. Although I'm a new grad, I bring three (or four, depending on how you count!) years of solid experience to the table. My journey in programming began at the age of 12 with Pascal, and a lot has happened since then. Along the way, I picked up Python and C++, and during the first two years of my bachelor's, I actively participated in the ICPC, even securing some decent places on the semi-finals in Saint Petersburg. Then, I decided to shift towards something more practical, and that's where the story gets really interesting...</div>
          <div class="body-text">I've always been fascinated by algorithms, and my interest naturally gravitated towards Data Science. It was already a buzzword in 2018, and it aligned perfectly with my strengths. I began my journey with decision trees and simple clustering methods, and as I gained momentum, I decided to pursue a master's degree focusing on deep learning. Long story short, the Technical University of Munich seemed like the ideal place to continue my studies. To my surprise and delight, I was confidently accepted, and my journey continued in the beautiful city of Munich.</div>
          <div class="body-text">By the end of my bachelor's degree, I considered myself quite experienced in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, having taken multiple courses in these areas and worked with computer vision models for 1.5 years. I even used BERT in my bachelor's thesis (It was 2020-2021, nobody had heard of LLMs then!). So, during my master's, I decided to explore something new. The choice naturally fell on graph neural networks, which I find incredibly fun and beautiful. Graph programming tasks were always my favorite in the ICPC, and graph neural networks are extremely useful in sciences, representing a vast variety of objects, from brains to molecules. I immersed myself in courses and projects (check below :)) in this area, and my dedication culminated in my master's thesis. I developed a novel continual learning method for graph neural networks, achieving up to 30% improvement over current state-of-the-art methods (for a very specific task though).</div>
          <div class="body-text">While I've focused on graph neural networks for the past two years, I haven't ignored the latest trends in the field. I regularly keep up with recent papers on diffusion models and large language models. When the ChatGPT blog post was released, I tried to reproduce the RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) for GPT-2, as it seemed like a crucial element. It didn't quite work out, but it was a fun and valuable experience. Currently, I'm developing a Telegram bot that utilizes Retrieval Augmented Generation and LLMs to help answer questions in large groups. This project is motivated by my own group of 500 students in Munich, where many questions are asked that were sometimes already answered two years ago.</div>
          <div class="body-text">If you think I'm hyper-focused only on machine learning, you're mistaken! I've always been interested in building distributed systems and continuously strive to learn new things in that area. I've taken numerous courses on distributed systems, read the famous book with a boar on the cover, and frequently worked with cloud-based distributed systems during my machine learning projects. I've completed at least one project on each of the major cloud platforms â€” AWS, GCP, and Azure â€” but I have the most experience with AWS.</div>
          <div class="body-text">I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations, so feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or ideas. I'm looking forward to hearing from you!</div>
